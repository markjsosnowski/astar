# astar0
The A* search algorithm in Python 3. 

This program generates and solves a random maze of size based on user input. User can also choose the start and goal points of the maze. It uses unicode text characters to vizualize the maze and the solution. Size of the maze is indirectly limited by the size of the console being printed to. 

TODO Seperate the classes into their own files
